`elemon` is a tiny module that tries to provide a simple and yet efficient live-reload tool for developing [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) applications. You just need to pass the `app` and `BrowserWindows` and the name of the files that are associated with them as a parameter to the `elemon` function **after** your app is `ready`. Please check out the example below to see how you can easily use it to watch your app and cleanly reload it upon any changes. If the changed
file is the main app file, then it `relaunch` the app and `exit` the current instance. If the changed file is a file that is associated with a browser window, then that window will only be reloaded.

In fact, setting up a clean live-reload tool for developing an elenctron application is super simple by using the [Electron API](https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/master/docs). The api already comes with whatever you need; just add a watcher (like [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) or whatever watcher you like) and you are all set.

####Install

Please use `npm i elemon --save-dev`.

####Usage

**elemon(appOpts, windowsOpts)**

`appOpts`: `{Object}` `{app:, res: ''}`

the `appOpts` object has:

 * `app` {[app](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/app.md) object} main app object
 * `res` `{String}` main app file name

`windowsOpts`: `{Array<Object>}` `[{bw:, res: []}]`

each object has:

 * `bw` {[BrowserWindow](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/browser-window.md) object} browser window object
 * `res` `{Array<String>}` array of any file name that is somehow associated with this browser window
   - _if you want to watch all files in dir, or if you want the `bw` to be reloaded on any changes and not necessarily changes on specific file(s), leave the `res` as empty `[]`._

####Example

Suppose it is ,a very simplified, app file structure:

```
example_proj
  |
  |__view
  |     |__reg.html
  |     |__login.html
  |     |__reg_handler.js
  |     |__login_handler.js
  |
  |__stylesheets
  |     |__style.css
  |
  |__app.js

```
then, in the main process file where usually app and browser windows are created:

*app.js*

```js

const electron = require('electron')
const {app, BrowserWindow} = electron
const elemon = require('elemon')

const reg_index = `file://${__dirname}/view/reg.html`
const login_index = `file://${__dirname}/view/login.html`
var reg_win = null
var login_win = null

function create_wins() {

  reg_win = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 600,
    height: 400,
    ... // other stuff
  })

  login_win = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 600,
    height: 400,
    ...
  })
}

// ... and other usual stuff ... //

app.on('ready', () => {
  create_wins()

  // this is all that you have to add to your main app script
  var app_opts = {app: app, res: 'app.js'}
  var win_opts = [{bw: reg_win, res: ['reg.html', 'reg_handler.js', 'style.css']}
                , {bw: login_win, res: ['login.html', 'login_handler.js', 'style.css']}]
  elemon(app_opts, win_opts)
})
```

That's it. Have fun writing your [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) applications.
